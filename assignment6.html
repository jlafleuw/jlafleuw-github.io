        <h1>Assignment 6: Molding and Casting Part 2</h1>

        <p>
            When we left off at Part 1, I had realized my 3D printed mold was inverted from how it was supposed to be, so I set out to make a new mold, the correct way for the project.  <br />
            I decided to make a sort of 3D-but-flat cat/tulip shape (it came out as more of a tulip in Cura, but looks like a cat in Rhino), and I wanted to make keys for easier casting. <br />
            There was method to my madness in printing this kind of shape, and it is related to my final project (I was getting practice). <br />
            <br />

            <img src="FinalMoldRhino-100.jpg" width="600" /> <br />
            So far, all seemed well. <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Once I had finalized the measurements I wanted for my mold in Rhino, I made STL files, and went to work in CURA for printing. Again, in Cura, I seemed to have no problem getting my measurements in, everything looked good. <br />
            <br />

            <img src="Cura2KittyMold-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            Again, so far, so good. <br />
            <br />
            Then I sent the mold to print ( a 1.5-hour print job), and I found that, while the mold printed, the printer destroyed the keys.  I thought that perhaps they and/or the mold were too small, so I went back to Rhino to adjust. <br />
            <br />
            This is why there are numerous source files below - I had to make several changes in Rhino, and still the 3D printers (I have 2 working now that I got more new nozzles) would not print the keys. <br />
            <br />
            I was running short on time to finish the assignment, so I decided to go ahead and cast with the numerous molds I had printed instead, and to find ways to hold them together externally. <br />
            <br />

            It was time to get out the OOMOO and cast the molds.  I set up some molding trays to contain overflow, and set up a station for mixing the OOMOO.  Then I cast the molds. <br />
            <br />

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I let the OOMOO cure for 10 hours, overnight. In the morning, I took apart the molding trays and peeled my molds from the 3D printed originals. <br />

            <img src="PeelingMolds3.jpg" width="600" /> <br />
            <br />
            I needed to trim some excess silicone from around the molds. <br />

            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I had molds!  I had 2 identical molds and 1 that turned out a bit different, so I decided to cast hydrostone plaster into all of them, in three (3) batches. I mixed a little pigment into each batch. <br />
            <br />

            <img src="Measuring.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            I used hair clips only to keep the molds together for the first batch, using a disposable pastry tube for injecting plaster through the pouring spout. I used a combination of toothpicks (like screws) and hairclips for the 2nd and 3rd rounds. <br />
            <br />
            Round One: <br />
            <img src="Batch1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="Batch1.2.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            Round Two: <br />
            <img src="Batch2.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            Round Three: <br />
            <img src="Batch3.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            Takings the hydrostone casts out was fun. <br />

            <img src="Batch3Uncasting4.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            I enjoyed many plaster messes. <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <b>FINAL RESULTS</b> <br />
            <br />
            In my first two batches a few pieces came out a bit uneveen and had to be sanded down a little to look nicer. The third batch came out better than the first two. <br />
            <br />
            <img src="PlasterPiece1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="PlasterPiece2.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            Due to printing problems (which have led now to the need for another replacement extruder (sigh!), I have two very similar molds and one a bit more vertical. So instead of 4 identical pieces, I ended up with 3 identical from one of the similar molds, <br />
            2 identical pieces from the other similar mold (it is just a bit smaller), and 3 identical pieces from the more vertical mold. I was running out of time, so a fourth round of casting was not possible. <br />
            <br />
            Here are my casts, along with their molds, and then with all of the pieces of this project together. <br/>

            <br />
            Finally, I was finished! <br />
