                Here is all the documentation for assignment 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preliminary Sketches/Ideas, Measured:<br />

                <img src="ExtShapes-100.jpg" width="500" />
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I had a nice, simple set of shapes in mind, I set out to work in Grasshopper to create them.  My first attempts did not go well:<br />
                <img src="EarlyTryGH-100.jpg" width="500" />
                <img src="EarlyTryGH2-100.jpg" width="500" />
                <img src="EarlyGHTry2.1-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
                I had to get some help from my tutor and watch some tutorials before I could work out the math that was going to allow me to set up shapes with notches in them.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a lot of experimentation and late nights, I finally developed the shapes I was aiming for.  There was a lot of math to work out, which was a struggle for me. Figuring out how to place the notch
                rectangles in the right places on each shape required a full set of GH code that was separate from the code setting up the initial shape, and required a third code set to tie everything together. <br />
                First is the triangle: <br />
                <img src="GHforTriAll-100.jpg" width="500" />
                <img src="GHforTri2-100.jpg" width="500" />
                <img src="TriangleShapeRhino-100.jpg" width="600" /> <br />
                Next is the pentagon/polygon: <br />
                <img src="GHPentagon-100.jpg" width="600" />
                <img src="GHPentCode1-100.jpg" width="600" />
                <img src="GHPentCode2-100.jpg" width="600" /> <br />
                Finally, the rectangle: <br />
                <img src="RhinoRect-100.jpg" width="600" />
                <img src="GHforRect1-100.jpg" width="600" />
                <img src="GHforRect2-100.jpg" width="600" />
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally it was time to convert the GH files into Ai in the MILL: <br />
                <video width="350" height="700" controls>
                <source src="FilesintoAI.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
                </video>  <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                And run my laser cutting: <br />
                <img src="ForLaserCutting-100.jpg" width="500" />
                <video width="500" height="350" controls>
                <source src="CuttingVid.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
                </video>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I had my cut pieces, what to make with them? It was definitely going to be abstract: <br />
                <img src="Pieces1.jpg" width="500" />
                <img src="Pieces2.jpg" width="500" />
            </p>
            <p>
                My final results were what I expected - abstract: <br />
                <img src="FullyAssembled.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            </p>
            <p> But could it survive the shake test? <br />
                <video width="600" height="400" controls>
                <source src="ShakeTest.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg" />
                </video> <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                Lessons were learned: <br />
                I had only just firgured out how to operate basic functions in Rhino when this assignment was given to us. I had less time to do it, given that we had long ago planned a weekend getaway to celebrate my 50th birthday.
                Grasshopper is not intuitive, but once I had it demonstrated to me at a moderated speed with all of the functions explained it started to make a lot more sense to work with. I wish we'd had a lot more time to learn
                Grasshopper (and to have practiced Rhino) before this assignment, but sometimes, I guess, we have to cram. <br />
