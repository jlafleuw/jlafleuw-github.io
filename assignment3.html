            <B>Here is my documentation for assignment 3:</B>
        </p>
        <p>
            It took an entire day to put the Ender-3 Pro together and complete the level tests! <br />

        <p>
            My very first print didn't go so well - I learned that the bed should be 70 degrees, not 60, to avoid the PLA sticking to the print and sliding it around the bed:<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            I had to carefully measure and develop my shapes in Rhino, which meant being absolutely certain that the default setting was on centimeters and not millimeters. I also learned that if I clicked the dot on the gumball arrows that I could type in the number of measurement in a text box - very handy shortcut!:<br />
            <img src="CubeTubes-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />

            <img src="AllShapes-100.jpg" width="600" /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
           Then came Cura, and experiments in its various settings. Turns out its not too difficult, though I did get confused on the spiralized tube. Still, I was, after many tries, able to get everything printed: <br />
            <img src="NewCube-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="CuraCylinder-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="SpiralizedCyl-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Some shapes came out pretty well on the first print.  Some didn't start off very stable, and I had to abort those print jobs. My tubes and cylinders came out at 2.7cm instead of 3, though I don't know why. I did not have time to reprint them, so I rounded up.. <br />
            <br />
            Here are my cubes: <br />
            <img src="NewCube-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="LowestCube.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="LowestCubeCalips.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="NEWConcenCube.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="NEWCubes1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="NEWCubes2.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="NEWAllCubes.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            Again, while the cubes measured perfectly in Rhino and Cura, they came out at 27.1, so just a little off. I have to keep working on adjustments, but as this was my second run of cubes, I was out of time for a third. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are my tubes: <br />
            <img src="NEWSingleExtTubeCalips1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            As you can see, I did have a change to re-print my single layer extrusion tube, and now it was over 3cm, but only by a small measure. <br />
            <img src="NEWSingleExtTubeCalpis2.jpg" width="500" /> <br />

            <img src="NEWTubes.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are my cylinders:<br />
            <img src="CylsnTubes.jpg" width="550" /> <br/>
            <img src="Spiralized.jpg" width="500" />
            <img src="SpiralizedBottom.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            Oops. <br />
            <img src="CylwSupports2.jpg" width="500" />
            <img src="CylwSupports1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="001TolCylinder.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            This is .001 Tolerance. <br />
            <img src="01TolCylinder.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            This is 0.1 Tolerance. <br />
        </p>
        <p>
           Here are all the initial shapes, before starting on my nested object: <br />
           <img src="Everything1.jpg" width="500" <br />
           <img src="Everything2.jpg" width="500" <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Now it was time to start sketching out what I envisioned for my nested object: <br />
            <br />
            I did have real-world inspiration for my idea in a set of wooden nesting balls I'd received as a child: <br />
            <img src="Inspiration.jpg" width="500" /> <br/>
            <br />
            <img src="SketchMeas-100.jpg" width="550" /> <br />
            <br />
            <img src="DraftNestedObject-100.jpg" width="550" /> <br />
            Wow.  Well, that was going to take over 2 days to print!  I had to re-think, and fast - I was running out of time (and very short on sleep). <br />
            <br />
            New idea - Half-spheres nesting a sphere in the middle.  Only 19 hours!  I could get that done in the nick of time! <br />
            <br />
            I came up with a new sketch: <br />
            <br />
            <img src="NEWEarlySketch.jpg" width="550" /> <br />
            <br />
            Then I set to work on Rhino: <br />
            <img src="NEWNestedObjectDraft-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="NEWNestedObjDraft2-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="RhinoDesignNewNesting-100.jpg" width="550" /> <br />
            <br />
            Off to Cura for adjustments and ensuring my nesting layers were of the desired thickness (double extrusion) and that the center sphere was solid.  I had to import two files (the center sphere and the two outer layers) and assemble them in Cura: <br />
            <br />
            <img src="NEWCuraNested-100.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            Then the printer malfunctioned. I had to clean out the nozzle and the PRFE tube and then reload filament, relevel the printer - which took three tries - and then start to try and print my nested object. Unfortunately, finding the right heat for the nozzle and bed took a few tries too, and I still didn't find the perfect combination. The glass plate also warped, so I don't recommend using those. <br />
            <br />
            I started my "well, it's the best so far" print job finally, 4 hours later than planned, The job is over 19 hours, and I started it at 9PM on Monday night, so I don't think it will be finished in time for Tuesday's class. <br />
            <br />
            Here is my nested object printing after 13.5 hours, with 6 hours to go: <br />
            <img src="6hourstogo.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            Soon after, I realized that the printer wasn't printing anymore, just going through the motions, hovering over the nested object. Upon a closer look, I realized that the casing around the nozzle was melting over the nozzle: <br />
            <br />
            <img src="NozzleMeltFailure1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <img src="NozzleMeltFailure2.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            This left me with a partially complete nested object: <br />
            <img src="Nested1.jpg" width="500" /> <br />
            <br />
            At this point, after such a large number of printer-related failures during this project, I have filed a complaint with Creality (luckily I have documentation), and I have ordered a higher-quality Ender series printer.  Numerous breakdowns and problems hold up projects, add stress, deprive me of sleep, and take up too much time. <br />

            These are images of my partially finished nested object (which is, technically, still a nested object). <br />
