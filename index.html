                My name is Jody Laflen. I'm in my second year as an HCDE masters student and excited to learn all about digital fabrication. 
                I know this will be challenging, since I do not already know how to work in CAD, but I will give it my best.

                        Assignment 3 was an exercise in assembling the Ender-3 Pro printer, learning how to level test, 
                    and then, using Rhino and Cura, figure out how to print a series of shapes with specific parameters.

                        While everything in this assignment that could go wrong did, I managed to struggle through with a sort of box.  
                    I went to the Mill twice to try my box pattern on the CNC mill, but could not get things to work out, so I resorted to the 3D printer due to lack of time.

                        This was a fun assignment, downloading and playing with different mesh objects and mesh types before deciding on what pairing 
                    I wanted to make and print.  I ran into some problems when I had to figure out how to fix the extruder and replace the nozzle, but I did that, too!

                        This is the first half of my work toward building a lamp, I have been experimenting with styles, and 
                    figuring out, with my current skill set, what I can realistically make (while still challenging myself).
